# Firefox Extensions

<section>

These are all of the Firefox extensions I use. Ads, paywalls, and user tracking suck, so most of these extensions are focused on limiting those. But, there are some other helpful ones thrown in there.
* [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/): Adds more emotes and features to Twitch and YouTube Live
* [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean): Gets you past the paywall blockers from news sites
* [ClearURLs](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/): Removes unnecessary tracking elements from the URL
* [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/): My favorite extension by far. Makes all webpages dark mode! They even have an iOS Safari extension, but it costs money
* [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/): My search engine of choice, since it doesn't use 3rd party tracking. Allegedly plants trees for your searches
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere): Automatically uses HTTPS security on websites
* [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/): Automatically redirects Fandom wikis to better independent wikis
* [Keepa](https://keepa.com/): Adds a price history graph on Amazon detail pages
* [Search by Image](https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image): A tool to search any image across multiple search engines at once
* [Simple Tab Groups](https://github.com/drive4ik/simple-tab-groups): One of my favorites for tab management. Allows you to create groups of tabs, assign icons/colors to them, and easily switch between them
* [SponsorBlock for YouTube](https://sponsor.ajay.app/): Adds the ability to not just skip in-video ads (e.g. this video is sponsored by xyzVPN), but also intros, outros, and other filler content
* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin): The best ad & tracker blocker out there
