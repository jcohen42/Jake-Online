# Decorable

<section>

Decorable is a game I've been working on with my friends. We've been working on-and-off as a hobby project since late 2022. The game is a visual novel/dating sim where the dates are turn-based, like an RPG! It's your first semester of college, and everyone here is so cool! Spend your days going to class, working out, talking to your friends, and finding your personal style. Soon after moving into the dorms, you'll meet Maeby or Marcel and go on a date with them. The clothes you wear affect your stats!

The day uses a time progression system, similar to Persona. You can choose how to spend each day. Do you want to gain some confidence at the gym? Sharpen your wit in classes? Or take some time to do some birdwatching? The choice is yours, but spend your time wisely. You'll need the best stats to be able to deepen your romantic connection with Maeby or Marcel.

The game is still in a very early state, and there's so much more we want to add! For instance, the player can only perform one activity per day, but we'd like to increase that to two or three. We'd also like to expand on the overworld, enabling new activities for the player. The game will play out over the course of the semester, so there's a lot the player should be able to spend their time on.

Play the [demo on itch](https://puppydoggames.itch.io/decorable)! The game is available on both Mac and Windows.

# Macintosh Classic Kiosk (PROJECT: Macaroni)

<section>

Back in 2017, when I was first getting into retro computers (thanks 8BitGuy), I saw a 1984 Macintosh Plus at my local games store. I really wanted to get my own and "modernize" it, which was the whole inspiration for this project. Now, the price was pretty steep, so I did some research and found a cheap, broken 1991 Macintosh Classic on eBay. So I bought it, ripped out the corroded hardware, Retrobrited it, and installed a Raspberry Pi inside! This was my first hardware project, so the internals were pretty janky. For the software, I installed EmulationStation and bought some wireless 8bitdo SNES controllers to play retro games on. I also bought a [USB adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000067V8L) that allowed the original mouse and keyboard to work!

Since then, the Macintosh has gone through multiple changes. The rubber bands holding up the screen snapped (surprise surprise), so I 3D printed a new mount for it, which has held up great so far. I also swapped out EmulationStation for Kodi for a bit, which looped through whatever media I have installed on it during the day (like Daft Punk's movie, early Sailor Moon episodes, Evangelion, similar stuff). Since the display is a 4:3 aspect ratio, media from before the mid-2000's fit pretty well.

Nowadays, I think the project has hit a fitting end. I [forked a repository called SystemSix](https://github.com/jcohen42/SystemSix) that I found on GitHub which emulates the Macintosh OS that ran on the original hardware. It displays weather information, the current moon phase, and I also modified the code to show bus arrival times. It's pretty handy to not need to pull out my phone when I'm thinking of heading out!

# Ashleystuck

<section>

Ashleystuck is a Homestuck parody I made for my partner's birthday, starring both of us! I copied the HTML and CSS from the actual Homestuck website (pls don't sue me) and created a shortened, bastardized version of the first act of Homestuck. Instead of entering Sburb before the world is destroyed, we talk on Discord and play Minecraft :) Here are a couple images I made for the website!

# Engram: A Pure English Programming Language

<section>

Engram is a programming language I made for my college thesis project. It contains a parser and compiler bundled into a cute little IDE Windows application. The lexer, parser, and compiler were created using the C++ programming language. The IDE was created using C# and the .NET Framework.

Engram is a programming language meant for first-time programmers. It's intended for children in elementary school, but its concepts can be useful to anyone interested in learning critical programming language concepts. Unlike other programming languages, Engram is written using simple English sentences.

I have intentionally kept Engram simple, meaning programmers will not have as much freedom with it when compared to fully-fledged languages like C or Java. However, Engram does support vital functions like variable operations, input/output, functions, and loops. These concepts are taught in detail in the online tutorial, which you can find below.

See [the GitHub page](https://github.com/jcohen42/Engram) for more information, including download links and a written tutorial! Engram (and the Engram Editor) can only run on Windows computers. The Engram Editor is a resource-light application, so do not worry if you have an older or less-powerful computer.

# Super Famicom Raspberry Pi

<section>

I got lucky at a retro games store and managed to snag a Japanese Super Famicom for like 3 bucks. Inspired by the Mac Classic Kiosk, I decided to throw a Raspberry Pi in there and install EmulationStation and some SNES ROMs. I already had the Bluetooth 8bitdo controllers, so luckily I had almost all the materials I needed - except for the screen. But, one day I was watching YouTube (I think it was an LGR video), and saw this wonderful 3D-printer CRT-style monitor housing [from Laser Bear Industries](https://www.laserbear.net/products/copy-of-crt-style-9-7-lcd-case?variant=44583556939988). I though it would be a perfect fit for this project, so I ordered it in beige, as well as a display from eBay.

Once I got all the parts, I threw them into the Famicom case, making sure I kept the cartridge port so I can keep cartridges in for aesthetic purposes. I also got a [keystone jack holder 3D-printed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2085237), so that I can plug in USB, HDMI, and power cables without the inside of the system becoming exposed.

# Dead End Dungeon

<section>

Dead End Dungeon is an Android game that I made in high school. It was the first large-scale game I worked on. The game is a rougelike dungeon crawler with randomly-generated floors, enemies that chase you, and a staircase to the next floor hidden somewhere. Your knight never stops moving (like Pacman), and you can change directions by swiping in cardinal directions. There's also a D-pad you can use to send arrows flying towards enemies. It was released to the Google Play Store, but I've since taken it down.
